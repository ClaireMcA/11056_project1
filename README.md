## Diving into the Content
When we were first given the site to redesign, I began by working my way through every page on the site and the content that it contained. After I felt like I had a solid understanding of all the section that the site contains I begain to copy all the text-based content into a word document where I could shuffle it around and combine sections that have similar content.
